    <h1>Please use a code block!</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Pasting raw code into a chat or forum hurts readability and makes it
      harder for people to help you. The reasons for this are listed below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>It's hard to read.</h3>
        <p>
          Computer code is <em>always</em> rendered using a
          <em>monospace</em> typeface. This means each character is a set width.
          W is the same width as I for example. When programmers see code that's
          not rendered with a monospace typeface, such as in a chat app or
          internet forum, it's not how they're used to reading code and makes it
          a little harder to read quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>It blends with surrounding text.</h3>
        <p>
          Code and discussion should be visually separate. If you're describing
          a problem in a piece of code then write the code directly underneath
          without using code blocks, it can be difficult to distinguish where
          the explanation ends and the code begins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Some platforms support syntax highlighting!</h3>
        <p>
          Most platforms that use Markdown code blocks also support syntax
          highlighting for common programming languages and file formats! By
          using a code block with highlighting, it makes the code more readable
          by programmers who are accustomed to reading code in their editors.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How do I post code properly?</h2>
    <p>
      Most platforms have settled on
      <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/"
        >Markdown</a
      >
      as the preferred formatting language:
    </p>
    <pre>
```js
(async function(){
  let books = await getAllBooks();
  console.log(books);
})();
```
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice how <code>js</code> follows the <code>```</code>, this indicates
      which syntax highlighting to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully this has been informative. Now whenever you're helping someone
      and they share some code or error messages directly into the chat without
      using a code block, help them anyway but direct them here so they don't
      make the same mistake next time!
